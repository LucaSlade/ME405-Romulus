## Software

# Modular Structure
Each piece listed above is individually implemented into a navigation task allowing for various combinations of obstacles to be overcome with ease along a specified course. This structure is essential for adaptability and larger tracks.

## **Motor and Encoder Control**
 - `Driver_Motors.py`: Handles PWM-based motor control.
 - `EncoderDriver.py`: Reads encoder counts to determine distance and velocity.
 - `Task_MotorController.py`: Implements FSM for motor commands.

## **Sensor Integration**
 - `LinesensorDriver.py` and `Task_LineFollower.py`: Detects and tracks line.
 - `Driver_BumpSensor.py` and `Task_BumpSensor.py`: Detects physical obstacles.
 - `BNO055_Driver.py` and `BNO055_Task.py`: IMU-based heading control.

## **Task Management**
 - `cotask.py`: Implements a cooperative multitasking system.
 - `task_share.py`: Manages shared variables between tasks.

## **Control Algorithms**
 - **Line Following**: Uses PID control to adjust motor speed based on sensor input.
 - **Heading Control**: IMU data is used to correct drift and maintain heading while spinning in place.
 - **Stright Drive**: Incorporates PID control to maintain a given direction and adjust accordingly while driving.

## **FSM Navigation Design**

 - **S0_STANDBY:** Wait for user input. 
 - **S1_LINE_FOLLOW:** Follow the track using sensor data.
 - **S2_STRAIGHT_DRIVE:** Move in a set direction.
 - **S3_LINE_FOLLOW:** Follow the track using sensor data.
 - **S5_TURN_TO_HEADING:** Turn to a set direction.
 - **S6_STRAIGHT_DRIVE:** Move in a set direction.
 - **S7_LINE_FOLLOW:** Follow the track using sensor data.
 - **S8_REVERSE:** Reverse away from wall after collision.
 - **S9_TURN_TO_HEADING:** Adjust based on IMU heading.
 - **S10_DRIVE_TO_FINISH:** Use the IMU and encoder distance to make 3 straight segments and two turns before stopping

## Overall Code Structure
- At the top we have our high level code which we use to create objects, tasks, and run the scheduler. Between is the Middle Level code which implements each generator function and uses the share information. At the low level is the code that interfaces with the hardware. This is where each driver is created.

# **Challenges & Shortcomings**
 - Implementing Bluetooth: Since there was no common structure for how to incorporate Bluetooth communication, finding the path to successful wireless instruction took many hours of trial and error to find the right baudrate and UART channel. Even after proper configuration and setup, the module would only receive and write once every 20-30 minutes. Looking back avoiding Bluetooth overall would save much more time than the value that it provided.
 - IMU noise: The controller for the heading changes would often over saturate and rotate farther than desired. A solution was to implement filtering to stabilize readings, allowing the heading to have a small range instead of a single fixed value.
 - Task Timing: A rather large challenge was tuning the task period and priorities to ensure reliability and speed. If more time was permitted, this design would have had much more time efficient task periods to avoid tasks running late consistently.
 - Implementing Voltage Divider: Although a working voltage divider was built using 3 wires, a 15.2 kOhm, and a 7 kOhm resistor, there was not enough time to write the code to read the voltage readings directly from the batteries and incorporate this into a motor effort. This bypass allows for higher power efficiency allowing the rechargeable batteries to be used for longer periods of time without a recharge.
 - Coordinate Tracking: If more time was permitted, a coordinate system to keep track of the location of Romulus in 2D space would aid in completing the course in the fewest amount of orientation and straight path changes as possible. This would have been implemented with encoder and heading tracking.
